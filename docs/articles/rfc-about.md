# Everything you ever wanted to know about RFCs but were afraid to ask


## What is an RFC?

* RFC stands for **request for comments**. 
* An RFC is a detailed engineering specification that the R&D department submits following a standard template, based on an RFW. 
* It focuses on *how* and *when* specifications will be satisfied.

## When do you fill out an RFC?

* Only start an RFC after the related RFW is done.

## How do you fill out an RFC?

* RFXs are developed offline and published ONLY when ready
* An RFC should contain no more than two weeks worth of work.
* Each RFC work phase should:
   * Create value
   * Take less than a day
   * Be testable
   * Be converted to issue and linked to a PR so that your peer developers can review it and merge the code to main code.
   * Be placed in a project board to track the work phases.


* While filling out an RFC, a developer can reach out to their fellow developers to get opinions.
* It should be approved within three days after seeking aprroval from NT, Mikko, and Elie.

## Can you change an RFC once it is approved?

* An RFC details the entire development process for a unit of work. It's a sealed unit of action that doesn't change once it's started.
* Once an RFC is approved, it can't be changed, as that would be like playing on a football ground with shifting goal posts.


* The RFC has to be sealed and not changed so it to contain all information required to carry it out -- self-contained
