# How to name new repositories

Using as an example a repo that is the "frontend" for "something":

*   If you're creating a production repository, name it `Something-Frontend`
*   If it's not a production repository, nor will it be in the future, name it `something-frontend`
*   Note how context comes first and specifics come second
*   Note how capitalization is handled in both situations
*   Names must not contain more than four words, but should strive to use two
