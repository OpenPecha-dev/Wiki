# Everything you ever wanted to know about RFCs but were afraid to ask

## What is an RFC?

* RFC stands for **request for comments**. 
* An RFC is a detailed engineering specification that the R&D department submits following a standard template, based on an [RFW](articles/rfw-about.md). 
* It focuses on *how* and *when* the specifications in an RFW will be satisfied.

## When should you fill out an RFC?

* Only start an RFC after the related RFW is complete.

## What do you need to know about filling in an RFC?

* You can get blank RFCs by navigating to OpenPecha/Requests > Issues > New Issue and selecting [RFC template](https://github.com/OpenPecha/Requests/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=RFC.md&title=%5BRFC%5D).
* You should work on RFCs in a text editor and only publish them when you are done.
* While you are working on an RFC, you can reach out to your fellow developers to get opinions.
* An RFC should contain no more than two weeks worth of work so that you can complete it in one sprint.
* RFCs are broken down into work phases.
* Each RFC work phase should:
   * Create value
   * Contain about a day of work or less for one person
   * Be testable
   * Be converted to issue and linked to a PR so that your peer developers can review it and merge the code to main code
   * Be placed in a project board to track the work phases

## What is the RFC approval process and how long does it take?

1. Publish your RFC on OpenPecha/Requests.
1. Let NT, Mikko, and Elie know that the RFC is ready and meet individually with each of them to get feedback. 
1. Refine your RFC based on their feedback.
1. Repeat steps two and three until the RFC is approved.

The approval process should take three days or less.

## Can you change an RFC once it is approved?

* No. An RFC is a sealed unit of action that doesn't change once it's started. Changing it would be like playing on a football ground with shifting goal posts.
