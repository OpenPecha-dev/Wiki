# Daily standups

* OpenPecha's daily standups happen from **4-5 p.m. IST** on Discord.
* Each team's standup takes up to 10 minutes.
* Each developer only needs to attend their team's standup.
* Each developer gets five minutes to answer these three questions:
   * What have you done today?
   * What are you going to do tomorrow?
   * What unexpected issues are you facing that are stopping you from completing your work items?

> **Note**: The sprint master may join the meeting to ensure that the meeting happens daily and on time.
