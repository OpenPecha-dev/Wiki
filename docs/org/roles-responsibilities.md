# Roles and responsibilities

The document explaining the roles, responsibilities, and communication lines of OpenPecha's management, application engineering and data engineering teams.

## Management

R&D management: 

* CTO [Name]
* SVP of engineering [Name]
* VP of engineering 
* Add VPs of engineering as needed

### CTO

The CTO supports economically viable value creation through science and technology.
#### Responsibilities

* Application development technology and methodology
* Infrastructure scalability, economics, and integrity
* Data practices, economics, and integrity
* Application, infrastructure, and data security
* Platform integration
* Future solutions discovery and prototyping
* Platform environmental impact
* Research and technology partnerships
* Developer experience
* R&D staff wellbeing
* R&D staff personal/professional development
* R&D staffing
* R&D budgeting and relevant financial modeling

These responsibilities include all the responsibilities of the R&D department. Non-CTO-specific responsibilities include participating in various company-wide activities such as management team meetings and seasonal planning.

#### Communication

The CTO reports to the CEO with additional direct lines to product owners and various R&D department participants. Intra-department communication lines are described in the corresponding sections for each team in the R&D department.

Leads of individual R&D teams report to the SVP of engineering. [If the CTO acts as the lead of a given R&D team, mention it here]. 

### SVP of engineering

#### Responsibilities

The SVP of engineering's responsibilities contrast with those of the CTO in the following ways. While the CTO is responsible for direction, the SVP of engineering is responsible for overseeing the fulfillment of that direction. While the CTO is responsible for building the team, the SVP of engineering is responsible for overseeing the team’s activity, etc.

#### Communication

The SVP of engineering has direct lines to the CTO and everyone else on the engineering team. Moreover, the SVP of engineering has direct lines with product team counterparts.

### VPs of engineering

#### Responsibilities

[Here choose between a) Each VP of engineering is responsible and the owner of the engineering aspect of individual product lines of OpenPecha, or b) VPs of engineering share the responsibilities of the SVP of engineering.]

#### Communication

The VPs' main direct communication lines are with their product team counterparts, R&D team leads, and the SVP of engineering.

## R&D teams

OpenPecha's R&D department consists of [three] teams with their respective functions.

* Application engineering
* Data engineering

### Application engineering (4 people)

#### Team composition

* Application engineering Lead (Tenzin)
* Backend engineer A (Kaldan)
* Backend engineer B (Lungzang)
* Frontend engineer A (Kunzang)

#### Responsibilities

The application engineering team is responsible for all development and engineering work that directly relates to OpenPecha’s solutions, both visible and not visible. 

* Increasing the variety across OpenPecha’s solutions 
* Increasing the quality across OpenPecha’s solutions 
* Increasing the ease of use across OpenPecha’s solutions 
* Improving the overall experience across OpenPecha’s solutions 
* Improving the energy efficiency across OpenPecha’s solutions 

In the future, the application engineering team might split into Frontend application engineering and backend application engineering.

#### Communication

Communication is primarily intra-department. For example, with infrastructure engineering (for infra needs) and with VPs of engineering and the SVP of engineering. Communication with product team counterparts is limited to request-for-work (RFW) and requests for comments (RFC) purposes.

### Data engineering (2 people)

#### Team composition

* Data engineering lead [Tashi Tsering]
* Data engineer [Topjor]

#### Responsibilities

The data engineering team is responsible for everything related to data.

* Data integrity
* Increasing the resiliency of data systems
* Maintaining data collection and preprocessing integrity
* Increasing the availability of data throughout the organization
* Increasing the ability to recover from catastrophic failures
* Improveing the energy efficiency of all data-related systems and processes

#### Communication

Communication is intra-department only. The data engineering team resources are allocated through application engineering. There are no inter-department communication lines, except for exceptional cases when it is necessary and justified. Requests for inter-department communication must go through the SVP of engineering.
