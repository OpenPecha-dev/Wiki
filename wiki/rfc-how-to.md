# How to fill out an RFC

**Notes from discussion with Mikko**

Conceptual/Overview
* RFW is the root text, RFC is the translations/commentary
* RFWs and RFCs are like instructions of analytical meditation, you... 
* Software engineering is 1/3 planning, 1/3 planning, 1/3 docs, test, etc. Thinks of programming as a tool

Who
* The developer should be part of the creation of the RFW and of previous steps

Rules
* Requests need to be labeled
* RFXs are developed offline and published ONLY when ready
* Every item should be filled in and no explanatory text should be left in the document
* RFXs should only be published when completed
* RFXs version should be updated every time there's a change

RFCs
* RFC only start when RFW is done
* RFC details all what will happen during the development process. It's a sealed unit of action that doesn't change once it's started.
* The RFC has to be sealed and not changed so it to contain all information required to carry it out -- self-contained

Misc
* Testing in the RFC is about planning the creation of tests. (not test-driven developpement, mainly about integration tests, testing input and outputs with corner cases / entropy)
* Infrastructure has to be considered to not having huge bills for RAM
